# VBA-Code
These are two different codes that I wrote in my free time at my previous jobs. 

The Pivot Tables code was used for manipulating hundreds of spreadsheets every quarter when I worked as a Reinsurance Analyst. I was given the task to delete the same specific columns from each spreadsheet, create a Pivot Table on a new sheet, then total the amounts.

The Weekly FX Rate Update code was used for my weekly task of copying a column of the current exchange rates for all countries, and pasting it onto a master spreadsheet which detailed historical exchange rates. The code opens the current exchange rate file, copies the column, opens the master spreadsheet, pastes the column, saves the file as a new spreadsheet, and locks the file from being manipulated.
